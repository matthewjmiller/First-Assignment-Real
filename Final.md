## Audience: High School Yearbook Instructor and the Students

{>> MM: I'll use this format to leave my notes on your assignment. Rather than just listing the audience here, work it into your text or title. <<}

## Introduction 

Taking pictures is a vital portion of any high school yearbook staff, for which the primary responsibility is documenting the year. Ultimately, pictures are the most effective way to remind people of memories they have long since forgotten. In a way, each picture can act as a gateway into the past, and the yearbook is a collection of pictures. However, taking good photos is an art that requires an understanding of the technical and composition knowledge in photography. For the high school students who are stepping into the responsibility of yearbook, this list should help give them a jump start into this new field. 

To truly help the students understand the basics of photography, I wrote a segment explaining the supplies needed, technical subjects including shutter speed, ISO, and aperature, and composition subjects such as lighting, the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing. Understandably, some of those terms are specialized jargin for photographers, but I am going to attempt to dissect them and put them in more basic diction for the students that are reading these instructions.

{>> MM: the diction is a little odd in this section; I'm not sure why the first person, such as "I wrote," is necessary here. <<}

## 1. Required Supplies

A. Camera
B. Camera Lense
C. Memory Card 

## 2. Recommended Supplies

A. Flash
B. Adobe Products

{>> MM: these look odd made into headings. Just provide a list. <<}

## 3. Technical Information: 

Three main features influence the quality of the pictures being taken when the camera is in its manual setting, shutter speed, ISO, and aperature. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to explain how to make the technical adjustments on a Canon camera since they are the type that your yearbook uses. 

{>> MM: whose yearbook? <<}

**Shutter Speed** is an important part of taking pictures even for beginners. It does exactly what its name indicates; it increases or decreases the speed of the lense's shutter. The faster it opens and closes, the less light makes it into the camera, and the slower it does so, the more light will enter. Whenever too little light enters, the picture comes out dark, and when too much light gets in, the photo begins to show the subtle shaking of the photographer's hands, making the image blurry. These are very common issues so you will want to make sure each member of your yearbooks staff know how to avoid them. Below I included an easy reference tool for the students as they go about taking pictures.

{>> I'm not sure what you're referring to. The next two lines? <<}

### A. Longer Exposure or Low Shutter Speed = Blurry Photos
### B. Shorter Exposure or High Shutter Speed = Freeze Motion

Photographers most commonly have the shutter speed resting at 1/60 but anywhere from 1/500, during fast-paced events like sports, to 1/8, for pictures like mugshots, will work. 

The shutter speed can be adjusted with a scroll tool in front of the picture-taking button, where the user will be resting their forefinger. Scrolling it counterclockwise will increase the shutter speed or lower the number on the screen, and scrolling it clockwise will decrease the shutterspeed or make raise the number.

**ISO** stands for International Standards Organization, the association that standardizes sensitivity technology for cameras. Likewise, the setting on the camera called ISO regulates how sensitive the device is to the light that enters the lense. By setting the ISO number lower, the lense becomes less sensitive, and the picture will be darker. In the same way, setting the ISO too high will result in a very bright photo. Ideally, each student should find the right setting for each situation. Below are a few common situations to help troubleshooting: 

### A. Sunny, No shade, Bright Scenes – 100 ISO
### B. Sunny, Little Shade, Bright Scenes – 200 ISO
### C. Overcast, Bright Indoor Scenes – 200-400 ISO
### D. Sunny, Near Sunset, Dimly Lit Scenes – 400-800 ISO
### E. Inside, By Window – 400 ISO and above 
### F. Inside, Not By Window – 600 ISO and above 
### G. Dark Indoor Scenes, Outdoor at Night – 1600 ISO

{>> MM: visual examples would really help with something like this. I understand you had some issues with that; if you had the time to ask me, I would have been happy to help. <<}

On a Canon camera, the ISO changes with the same scroll function as the shutterspeed. Although, the students will need to hold down the ISO button next to the scroll bar while they rotate it. I included a picture of this below to add some clarity.

**Aperture** or F-stop is the final technical aspect of taking pictures that the yearbook students should know. A lens aperture is the opening that controls how much light passes through. A camera is equipped with a range of openings referred to as F-Stops. The larger the F-Stop, the smaller the opening, resulting in less light passing through. Below is a basic guide to aperture setting depending on how many people are in the picture and the distance between the photographer and the focus of the shot.

### A. 1 person = 1.2-2.8 {Blurry Background}
### B. 2 people = 2.8 or 3.5 {Blurry Background}
### C. 3 people = 3.5 or up {Less Blurry}
### D. 4 people = 4.5 or up {Less Blurry}
### E. 5 people = 5.5 or up {Clear Background}
### F. Depth of Field – What is in or out of focus
#### i. Shallow - Good for isolating subjects
#### ii. Deep – Good for Landscapes

{>> MM: same note as above; this is hard to retain without visuals. <<}

## A. Lighting

Slightly cloudy days are optimal for picture-taking because the photographer has more control over what light is added or taken away from the picture. However, since the situation is not always ideal, I will go through some of the main points for understanding lighting. 

### 1. Frontlit Images
  
Taking pictures with the sun shining from behind you onto the subject is a good way to make sure the photo turns out well and the victim of your photo is completely blind. However, if the lighting is too direct or bright, it can cause the subject to be over-exposed. 

### 2. Sillhouettes or Backlit Images

When the subject is backlit, it makes seeing them almost impossible, but it can be used as a creative sillhouette image in the right context. This is a more artistic approach to photography, so it will not always be a practical tool for yearbook. However, for divider pages between chapters, the title page, or the cover could profit from this approach. Any instance that the subject needs to be clearly seen is an example of when backlighting your subject is not a good idea.

{>> MM: is something missing here? The introduction mentions "the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing," and the FAQ is missing as well. <<}
